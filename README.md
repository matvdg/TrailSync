Trail Sync retrieves workouts from Apple Health (iPhone or Apple Watch), converts them into GPX files, merges tracks when needed, and syncs data seamlessly across macOS and watchOS using SwiftData.

## Download
[Download for iOS / iPadOS / watchOS / macOS / visionOS 26+ on AppStore](TODO)

## Key features
- Fetch workouts from Apple Health (Apple Watch or iPhone) and convert them to GPX files
- Merge GPX files
- Apple Fitness, finally on Mac! Your walking, hiking, cycling, and running workouts seamlessly sync to macOS
- While you can view your last workout on Apple Watch, you can’t see your trails on a map — TrailSync lets you browse all your routes and maps right on watchOS
